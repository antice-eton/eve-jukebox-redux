# EVE Jukebox Redux

Back in the day, EVE Online had a jukebox of sorts.

EVE Jukebox Redux is what it could have been.

THIS IS STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT

## Features

Configure playlists of music to play based on various conditions of where you are, such as which station, security status, sovereignty, or region.

Have the Star Wars cantina play when you're docked in Jita 4-4. Why wouldn't you want do that?

## Playlists from where?

First release will support Foobar2000 and Spotify. Youtube will be next. Additional services or players? Not sure. I'm guessing VLC support is feasible. As for other streaming services, I wrote this with plugins in mind so if anyone wants to contribute a plugin, reach out!
